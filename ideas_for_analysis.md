- See more on the amount of videos uploaded using the complete dataset to do the analysis.
- Do a normalization when comparing categories. (it is better to see the change in average).
- Try to use more the complete dataset instead of timeseries (comparing amount of videos), because we could see more changes because we have more information.
- See with minor sports. (how many people play that sport.).
  - To define engagement only amount of youtube videos is not completely correct.
- We can also have maybe a normalization based on amount of videos uploaded.
- analyze views or amount of videos about table tennis.
  - Using olympics as the major event.
  - Maybe also see tennis.
- It seems olympics have a lot of copyrights of who can upload videos and what you can upload.
